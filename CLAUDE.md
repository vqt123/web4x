# Web 4X Game Project Context

## Project Overview
We are building a turn-based, asynchronous web 4X game designed to be played over 2 weeks with multiple daily sessions.

## Key Design Documents
@game-design-doc.md
@development-plan.md

## Development Principles
- Start with text-based MVP to test pacing and mechanics
- Focus on making the first 30 minutes engaging
- Test each feature in isolation before integrating
- Action Point economy is core to the experience

## Current Development Phase
Building the initial MVP focusing on:
1. Action point system with regeneration
2. Basic movement and timers
3. First 30-minute player experience

## Important Reminders
- Players start with 150 AP
- Actions regenerate at 10 AP/hour
- First session should use ~100 AP over 30 minutes
- All actions should have meaningful costs and timers
- Keep the UI text-based until core mechanics are proven

## Testing Commands
<!-- Add test/lint commands here as we discover them -->

## Architecture Decisions
<!-- Document key technical decisions as we make them -->
