# Web 4X Game Design Document

## Core Concept
A turn-based, action-per-time based web 4X game inspired by RTS mechanics, designed to be played over a 2-week period with multiple short sessions per day. The game abstracts away spatial elements, focusing on resource capacity discovery and development through strategic action point allocation.

**Current Implementation Status**: Phase 1 Enhanced - Core mechanics with resource management and debug tools complete.

## Game Duration & Pacing
- **Total Game Length**: 14 days per match
- **Daily Sessions**: 3-4 times per day
- **Session Length**: 5-30 minutes (first session longest)
- **Design Philosophy**: Start with intense micro-management that naturally scales to macro strategy

## Action Point System

### Economy
- **Starting Points**: {actionPoints.starting} AP (full tank for crucial opening)
- **Regeneration Rate**: {actionPoints.regenerationPerHour} AP per hour
- **Maximum Storage**: {actionPoints.maximum} AP
- **Design Intent**: Encourages regular play without punishing missed sessions

### Action Scaling Over Time
**Days 1-2: Micro Management Phase**
- Low AP cost actions
- Individual resource discoveries
- Capacity vs generation decisions
- Every decision is meaningful

**Days 3-7: Tactical Scale**
- Medium AP cost actions
- Multiple development projects
- Resource optimization
- Trade negotiations

**Days 8-14: Strategic Scale**
- High AP cost actions
- Economic warfare
- Mega-projects
- Alliance resource sharing

## First 30 Minutes - Critical Opening Session

### Minutes 0-5: Discovery Phase âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- Start with base generation rates from config
- Resources display format: "current/cap (+generation/Hr capacity/Hr Max)"
- **Explore Action** ({actions.explore.cost} AP): Roll for capacity increase
  - {actions.explore.discoveryRates.food}% chance: Food capacity increase
  - {actions.explore.discoveryRates.production}% chance: Production capacity increase
  - {actions.explore.discoveryRates.gold}% chance: Gold capacity increase
- **Develop Action** ({actions.develop.cost} AP): Convert capacity to generation (auto-completing timer)
- **Expand Storage** ({actions.expandStorage.cost} AP): Increase resource storage caps by {actions.expandStorage.capacityIncrease}
- Make multiple meaningful decisions about exploration vs development

### Minutes 5-10: Strategic Development
- Balance exploration (building capacity) vs development (actualizing it)
- First development completes during this phase
- Introduction of **Research** (configurable AP cost and timer) for multipliers
- Resource conversion/trading unlocked

### Minutes 10-20: Optimization Phase
- Multiple developments running simultaneously
- Specialization decisions (focus on one resource or balance?)
- First research completes, improving future actions
- Introduction of competitive elements (other players' progress visible)

### Minutes 20-30: Engagement Hook
- Major decision point with accumulated resources
- Unlock advanced actions (military, diplomacy, mega-projects)
- Clear goals for next session
- 2-3 timers running to encourage return

## Core Mechanics

### Time-Based Actions
- **Development**: {timers.development.productionTicks} ticks (converts capacity to generation)
- **Research**: {timers.research.productionTicks} ticks (improves efficiency multipliers)
- **Major Projects**: Extended timer durations (game-changing effects)
- **Trade Deals**: Shorter timer durations (resource conversion agreements)
- **Design Intent**: Creates anticipation and planning opportunities

### Resource System âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Basic Resources**: Food, Production, Gold
- **Capacity vs Generation**: 
  - Capacity = Maximum possible generation (increased through exploration)
  - Generation = Actual per-hour income (increased through development)
  - Storage Cap = Maximum resource accumulation (expandable)
- **Starting Values** (see @game-config.json):
  - Food: {resources.food.startingAmount} amount, {resources.food.startingGeneration}/hr generation, {resources.food.startingCapacity} capacity, {resources.food.storageCap} storage cap
  - Production: {resources.production.startingAmount} amount, {resources.production.startingGeneration}/hr generation, {resources.production.startingCapacity} capacity, {resources.production.storageCap} storage cap
  - Gold: {resources.gold.startingAmount} amount, {resources.gold.startingGeneration}/hr generation, {resources.gold.startingCapacity} capacity, {resources.gold.storageCap} storage cap
- **Growth Example**: Explore â†’ capacity increases by 1, then Develop â†’ generation increases by 1/hr
- **Storage Management**: Resources cap at storage limit, expansion available for {actions.expandStorage.capacityIncrease} capacity

### End Game & Scoring
- **Leaderboard-based**: No elimination or bankruptcy
- **Score factors**:
  - Total resource generation rate
  - Efficiency ratios (generation/capacity)
  - Research milestones achieved
  - Successful trades completed
  - Special achievements/projects
- **Final period**: Score multipliers increase to create exciting finish
- **Post-game**: See detailed stats and start next 2-week cycle
- (Exact scoring formula to be refined through playtesting)

## User Interface Design

### Current Implementation: Text-Based âœ…
```
Day 1, 00:05:23                           DEBUG MODE: {debug.speedMultiplier}x
Action Points: current/{actionPoints.maximum}        Tick: current
                                          Session: elapsed

Resources
Food: current/{resources.food.storageCap} (+generation/Hr capacity/Hr Max)
Production: current/{resources.production.storageCap} (+generation/Hr capacity/Hr Max)
Gold: current/{resources.gold.storageCap} (+generation/Hr capacity/Hr Max)

Active Developments
Resource development: timer countdown

[EXPLORE - {actions.explore.cost} AP]  [DEVELOP - {actions.develop.cost} AP]  [EXPAND STORAGE - {actions.expandStorage.cost} AP]  [DEBUG MODE]
```

**Key UI Features Implemented**:

## Development Approach

### Philosophy
- **5-Minute Chunks**: Build and perfect the game in 5-minute increments
- **Discovery Phase First**: Perfect minutes 0-5 before moving to 5-10
- **Validate Each Phase**: Don't proceed until current phase is engaging
- **Tight Feedback Loops**: Test each 5-minute chunk extensively
- **Connected Experience**: Each chunk must flow naturally to the next

### Development Phases
1. **Minutes 0-5**: Discovery Phase - Exploration rolls, capacity discovery, first developments
2. **Minutes 5-10**: Decision Phase - Capacity vs generation balance, research introduction
3. **Minutes 10-15**: Optimization Phase - Multiple developments, specialization choices
4. **Minutes 15-20**: Competition Phase - See other players' progress, trade opportunities
5. **Minutes 20-30**: Engagement Hook - Advanced actions unlock, major projects
