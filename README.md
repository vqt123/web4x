# Web 4X Game

A turn-based, asynchronous 4X strategy game designed to be played over 2 weeks with multiple daily sessions.

## Overview

This game combines the strategic depth of 4X games (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) with the pacing of mobile games and the tactical decisions of RTS games. Players spend Action Points to make decisions, with points regenerating over time.

## Key Features

- **2-week game cycles** with 3-4 play sessions per day
- **Action Point system** that encourages regular engagement
- **Asynchronous multiplayer** allowing players in different time zones
- **Progressive complexity** from micro to macro management

## Development Status

Currently in pre-MVP development. See [development-plan.md](development-plan.md) for current progress.
